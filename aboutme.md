Joel Oliveira started his professional career in 1998 as a researcher and since then, he already assumed different roles (from developer to tester, from technical and project manager to quality and engineering manager), managing and leading teams from 1 to 130 engineers in business areas so diverse as telecommunications, government and public sector, financial services, defence and security or aerospace.

In 2009, after a closer involvement with the software testing area, he founded the [first online testing community in Portugal|https://www.linkedin.com/groups/1769630] and one year later, the [PSTQB â€“ Portuguese Software Testing and Qualifications Board|http://www.pstqb.pt] becoming a member of the [ISTQB|http://www.istqb.org] working groups in 2011.

As a passionate about software testing & quality assurance, dedicated to improve recognition/proficiency of the testing community and eager to share his experiences, you can find him giving talks and workshops about software testing (manual, exploratory, automation, mobile, performance, security), engineering processes (waterfall, agile, continuous improvement and CMMI) or career management (mainly but not only for testers).
