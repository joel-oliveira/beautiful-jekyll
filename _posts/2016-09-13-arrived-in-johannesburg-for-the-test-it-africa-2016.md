In 2011, I visited Africa for the first time! The excuse was an invitation to talk in Mozambique about an integrated software development methodology.
On that visit, I actually crossed the border to South Africa, but just for a quick weekend in the Kruger National Park.

This time, it's for a full week in South Africa and after a long flight I'm ready for the [SASTQB TEST-IT AFRICA 2016 International Conference](http://www.sastqb-conf.org/).
